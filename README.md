Code and data for quality checking an AI Reporter for Climate Action in Transportation

- The `experiment/` folder shares all code necessary for running our quality control exercises.
- The AI reporter itself is not shared because it is intellectual property.
- However, we do share ~100 example reports generated by the AI reporter, used in our quality control experiment.

## Replicating the Experiment

You will need a `.env` file with an OpenAI API key to run the experiment.

It should look like this:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=insert_text_here
```
We provide a limited set of functions in `functions.R` necessary to replicate the experiment.

- Run `experiment/evaluate.R` - this script runs the AI queries to evaluate each report.
- Run `experiment/compare.R` - this script runs our statistical analyses and visualizations for the quality control analysis.- Skip `experiment/experiment.R` - this file describes how we generate the reports, for demonstration, but original code for the reporters themselves are kept private for IP reasons.
