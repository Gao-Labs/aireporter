Code and data for quality checking an AI Reporter for Climate Action in Transportation

- The `experiment/` folder shares all code necessary for running our quality control exercises.
- The AI reporter itself is not shared because it is intellectual property.
- However, we do share ~100 example reports generated by the AI reporter, used in our quality control experiment.
